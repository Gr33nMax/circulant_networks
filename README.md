# Circulant Networks
Development of a routing algorithm in networks with circulant topologies with three generators.

## Description
In this project I developed an algorithm for finding the shortest routes between two vertices in networks with a circulant topology 
to further adapt this algorithm to hardware description languages (HDL).

It needs because the standard Dijkstra's algorithm takes up a lot of resources and computing power in networks on a chip.

This project was created with the support of the National Research University "Higher School of Economics".

## Files
The file with the main developed algorithm is called ***"sequent.py"***.

Also in this project are files with other implementations of the routing algorithm.
***"polynom.py"***  goes through a lot of cases and gives guaranteed a sure result, but it takes a lot of resources on a chip.
